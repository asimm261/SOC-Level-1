# 📐 TryHackMe – Pyramid of Pain

**Room:** Pyramid of Pain  
**Path:** SOC Level 1  

---

## 🎯 What I Learned
- The levels of the Pyramid of Pain model (Hash → IP → Domain → Tools → Tactics, Techniques, Procedures).
- Why detecting at higher levels is more effective.
- How indicators like hashes and IPs serve different detection value.

---

## 🔍 Key Artifacts & Commands
- Hash examples from the exercises
- Domain lookup with punycode
- VirusTotal results for IPs and domains

## 📸 Screenshots

---

## 🧠 Reflections
- Higher-level detection benefits defenders more than relying on hashes.
- Practical takeaway: prioritize domain and technique-level detections.

## 📌 Next Steps
- Apply Pyramid of Pain concepts in Splunk correlation searches
- Continue on TryHackMe SOC Level 1 path (next: `Cyber Kill Chain`)
